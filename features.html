                            <p>Many early operating systems like MS-DOS relied heavily on Command Line Interfaces (CLI)
                                for user interaction. Users had to type commands to perform tasks like opening files,
                                running applications, or managing directories. While it lacked the simplicity of a
                                graphical interface, CLI was powerful and highly efficient for experienced users.</p>

                            <p>Classic operating systems, particularly before the mid-1990s, often supported only
                                limited multitasking. Early versions of Windows and Mac OS could run a few applications
                                simultaneously, but these systems lacked true multitasking capabilities, requiring users
                                to switch between tasks with limited background processing.</p>

                            <p>The introduction of basic Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) revolutionized user
                                interaction with computers. Early GUIs, like those in Windows 3.1 or Mac OS, made
                                computers more accessible by replacing complex command-line operations with icons,
                                windows, and drag-and-drop functionality, setting the stage for modern user-friendly
                                interfaces.</p>

                            <summary>Low Memory Usage</summary>
                            <p>Due to hardware limitations of the time, classic operating systems were designed to be
                                extremely efficient with memory usage. Systems like MS-DOS and early Windows versions
                                ran on as little as 1MB of RAM, making them suitable for the limited computing power
                                available in early personal computers.</p>

                            <summary>Legacy Hardware Support</summary>
                            <p>Classic operating systems were built to run on older hardware, often supporting a wide
                                range of peripherals and legacy devices like floppy drives, parallel port printers, and
                                CRT monitors. This backward compatibility allowed users to upgrade their systems without
                                needing to replace all their equipment.</p>
