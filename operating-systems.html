                            <p><strong>MS-DOS</strong> (Microsoft Disk Operating System) was one of the earliest and
                                most widely used command-line operating systems. Released in 1981, MS-DOS became the
                                backbone of personal computing throughout the 1980s. It lacked a graphical user
                                interface (GUI), requiring users to interact with the system via typed commands. Despite
                                its simplicity, MS-DOS introduced foundational concepts like the file system hierarchy
                                and batch processing, influencing future operating systems like Windows.</p>

                            <p><strong>Windows 3.1</strong>, released in 1992, marked a turning point in Microsoft's
                                push for GUI-based systems. It introduced users to a more intuitive interface, complete
                                with icons, file management through File Manager, and multi-tasking capabilities.
                                Windows 3.1 was also one of the first systems to include support for TrueType fonts,
                                revolutionizing desktop publishing and solidifying Windows' place in the home and
                                office.</p>

                            <p><strong>Windows 95</strong> was a game changer when it launched in 1995, blending the
                                graphical user interface with true multitasking support. It introduced the now-familiar
                                Start menu, taskbar, and Windows Explorer for file management. The system's
                                plug-and-play capabilities made it easier to install new hardware, and its support for
                                32-bit applications allowed for more powerful software development. Windows 95 set the
                                stage for modern desktop computing as we know it.</p>

                            <p><strong>Linux Kernel 1.0</strong>, released in 1994, was the first official stable
                                release of the open-source operating system kernel. Developed by Linus Torvalds, Linux
                                quickly grew in popularity due to its flexibility and the collaborative nature of its
                                development. While it initially appealed to hobbyists and tech enthusiasts, Linux soon
                                found a home in servers and enterprise environments. Today, it remains one of the most
                                important and widely used operating systems in the world.</p>

                            <p><strong>Mac OS 9</strong>, released by Apple in 1999, was the final iteration of the
                                classic Mac OS before the introduction of Mac OS X. Known for its elegant design and
                                user-friendly interface, Mac OS 9 introduced features such as multi-user login, improved
                                internet connectivity, and support for multiple file formats. It paved the way for
                                modern macOS by refining many of the core elements that made Apple's computers unique.
