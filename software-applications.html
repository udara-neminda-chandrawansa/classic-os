                                variety of new tools that made complex photo manipulation more accessible to users.
                                Photoshop 4.0 is often seen as a landmark release in the evolution of digital imaging

                                and tabbed browsing, it was instrumental in shaping the way people explored the web.
                                Netscape's innovations laid the groundwork for modern browsers like Firefox and Chrome.
